/*
Package okatype (i.e., Okanero type) provides basic types used for implementing the Okanero protocol.

With the Okanero protocol, there is a message-oriented layer to it.

The Okanero protocol calls its messages "datum".

(In Golang, we can think of serialized Okanero datum as a []byte.)

(You could probably safely conflate an Okanero datum with a "block" in a "blockchain".)
